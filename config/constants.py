Each button is programmed with a point value between 0 and 100 that does not change for that game. However, each time you choose the button it will give you points randomly around the button value. \nYour goal is to maximize your points by making good choices, and you have 20 trials to do so. You will play 10 rounds of this game. You will also receive a bonus based on the number of points (0 to 100) you won on one randomly selected trial from all the games. Each point is worth $0.03, which means you can win a bonus of up to $3.00. \nIn some games, you will receive a hint about the average button values on each game by a previous user. The hints may help you in the game.\n\nThis is a brand new game, and the arm values have been reset."
